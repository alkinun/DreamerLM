# DreamerLM: Dreaming Language Models To Self Improve

### Here's the current recipe in mind:

Here are some points:
 - A huge part of this research is inspired from [DreamCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08381).
 - As we sample seed data from wake phase, we dont need to have creativity in our LM to create new data.
 - Dreaming should help us make a more robust model for prompt changes.
 - Dreaming can also help us use the grounded data really efficiently like humans.
 - WPO will help us filter out the bad dreams with a low reward.
 - This should improve the models capabilities in each cycle without a plateau.

More testing + r&d + paper coming soon!
